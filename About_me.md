💡A rational dreamer💭

I could describe myself with the following quote from the movie "The Pursuit of Happyness": "I'm the kind of person that if you ask me a question and I don't know the answer, I'll tell you I don't know the answer. But I bet I know how to find the answer and I will find it."

🎩An Hyperactive, hungry for knowledge who like challenges where I give my best under pressure👔
